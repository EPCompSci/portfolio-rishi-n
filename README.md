# iOS Portfolio
Hi, my name is Rishi Natraj, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 9th grade, in the class AP Computer Science Principles, in which I made apps using MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. In 11th grade, I took an iOS App development in which I learned Swift. In 12th grade, I took the class again to learn more swift and make more apps. So far this year, I have made 1 working app as practice, and am currently working on another app with some classmates. 

## Apps and Projects
#### 2021-2022
### [Paper Man Adventures](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/VolcanicPanic)
This is an app I worked on to refresh my knowledge of XCode and Swift. It is a barebones remake of Volcanic Panic, a game I made a couple years ago in Java, but this time it is in Swift. I learned how to use SpriteKit to assist in making a game in XCode.

### [Spelunk Knight)](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight)
This is the app I made with a couple of classmates. It is a Metroidvania style platformer, which means that it is a two-dimensional open world game in which you control a character and fight enemies. We have successfully gotten it on the app store, and have an update planned. THe main character starts off with just a punching attack, but more attacks can be unlocked as you progress through the game. There are 3 types of enemies: a bat, a rat, and a skeleton. There is also a boss battle against a strong boss enemy. We used a tile-map to make the map, which was a new feature that I learned how to use. We also used SpriteKit Scenes to make the map, and had seperate files for each enemy.

#### 2020-2021
### [Calculator](https://github.com/rishi-n/calculator)
This was my first XCode app. I made it with many buttons all organized in many VStacks, HStacks, and ZStacks. Since this was my first app, I did not have the knowledge to implement a way for it to do the operations in the correct order, and only knew how to make it do the operations in the order they were entered. Since then, I have learned much more, and if I ever get back to improving this app, I will implement order of operations into it.

### [Apocalypse Survivor](https://github.com/sarthyparty/Infection-Tag)
This is the game that I worked on with friends, and it is in the appstore. It is a fully functioning game, with many features, such as moving a character with a joystick, zombies that follow your character and merge into bigger zombies if they collide, a boost button, and many more. As of today, we have submitted version 1.2 to the appstore, which contains features such as a score system, a gun to shoot zombies and ammo to pick up, and a puse screen with the option to resize the joystick and change its position, and flip the controls. We used many aspects of SpriteKit to create this game, and used PhysicsBodies for the interactions between all the sprites.

#### 2019-2020
### [Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)
This was a game I created with classmates in Java. In the process of making this game, I learned a lot about utilizing JFrames and JPanels. I also incorporated a timer into this game to keep track of the score. KeyListeners and ActionListeners were used to allow the arrow keys be used to move the character and to refresh the scene of the game 60 times a second.
